My solutions to 2023's advent.

This year I'm doing them on Python jupyter notebooks in order to keep the puzzle explanation next to the code that solves it. I've bearly touched python before so I'm taking this as an oportunuty to learn it.

For most of the latter puzzles it is very tempting to go back and addapt the first part to better fit with the seccond. In order to show how I aproached the question with no more information I try not to modify it. So you wont see any "spoilers" for the seconfd solution if you just look at my first. The most I've modified is putting the part that calulates the solution inside a function, where before it was simply in the main body of the code.
